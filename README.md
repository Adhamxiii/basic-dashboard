## Features

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics, including total revenue, subscriptions, sales, and active users. Each metric is represented visually with an icon, label, amount, and description for easy interpretation.

### Order Management

The order management feature enables users to view and manage orders efficiently. It displays information such as order ID, status, last order date, and payment method. Orders can be sorted and filtered based on various criteria for easy management.

### User Management

User management functionality allows administrators to view and manage user accounts. It displays user details such as name, email, last order date, and preferred payment method. Users can be searched, sorted, and filtered to streamline the management process.

### System Settings

The system settings section provides users with the ability to customize their experience. Settings such as account preferences, notifications, language, and theme can be adjusted according to user preferences.
